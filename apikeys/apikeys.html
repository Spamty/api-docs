<p>We have multiple classes of API keys (you can find them below).</p>

<p>You'll have to <a href="https://spamty.eu/contact-dev.php">request an API key via email</a>. Please provide following information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your name/company</li>
	<li>Your website/application website</li>
	<li>Your email address</li>
	<li>What you want to do with the API</li>
	<li>If this is a commercial project</li>
	<li>How many API requests you expect to send per week/day/...</li>
</ul>
<p>We will check your request and tell you if you are eligible to use this API.</p>


<h3>Class E</h3>
<p>This API key is used to generate a link to an email address with spamty.</p>
<p>See: <a href="{{site.url}}/encryption/">API Encryption</a></p>

<h3>Class D</h3>
<p>This key has to be used when you want to see an email address from a spamty link.</p>
<p>See: <a href="{{site.url}}/decryption/">API Decryption</a></p>

<h3>Class S</h3>
<p>Class S API keys are required to generate a short URL or to view a spamty link from a 3q3.de short url. We may limited the validity of your API key to 6 months. Then you need to request a new one.</p>
<p>See: <a href="{{site.url}}/shorturlcreate/">API Create a short URL</a> and <a href="{{site.url}}/shorturlview/">View a long URL</a></p>

<h3>Internal</h3>
<p>Some APIs require an additional internal authentication. This auth information is only available for staff members.</p>

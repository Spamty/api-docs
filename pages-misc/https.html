<h1>HTTPS</h1>
<p>You have to use use HTTPS for your API requests.</p>
<p>The domain api.spamty.eu has no verified SSL-certificate so you may get an error message.</p>

<h2>Fix</h2>
<p>If you are using PHP with curl you can add this to ignore the invalid certificate:</p>
<pre>
// ignore the invalid SSL certificate
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); 
</pre>

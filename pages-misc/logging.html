<h1>Logging</h1>
<p>All API requests are logged in our database. We will log your <strong>username</strong>, the <strong>date and time</strong> of the request, the <strong>status</strong> (error or success), a your <strong>IP address</strong> and some additional information.<br>
But we don't log any sensitive data.</p>

<p>Old logs are deleted regularly.</p>

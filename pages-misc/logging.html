<p>All API requests are logged in our database. We will log the following data from your request:
<ul>
	<li>your <strong>username</strong></li> 
	<li>the <strong>date and time</strong> of the request</li> 
	<li>the <strong>status</strong> (error or success)</li> 
	<li>your <strong>IP address</strong></li> 
	<li>and some additional information</li> 
</ul>
But we don't log any sensitive data like your API key.</p>

<p>Old logs are deleted regularly.</p>

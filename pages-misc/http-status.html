<p>The API will return one of these HTTP status codes:</p>

<h3>200 OK</h3>
<p>The response for a successful request. </p>

<h3>400 Bad Request</h3>
<p>The status 400 is returned if there was any error with the API. You will get a detailed information from the returned error details.</p>

<h3>403 Forbidden</h3>
<p>You'll get a <em>400 Bad Request</em> error code if authorization with API username and key failed. The <em>403 Forbidden</em> response is used if the API is only for internal use.</p>

<h3>404 Not Found</h3>
<p>This code is used when the API is not available. If it was available here but is now deprecated you will get a <em>410 Gone</em> response.</p>
<p>You may have typed in the wrong URL.</p>

<h3>410 Gone</h3>
<p>This code is used when the API is outdated and doesn't work anymore. You should look at the documentation to find the latest version.</p>

<h3>500 Internal Server Error</h3>
<p>If there were any technical problems with our server you will get a <em>500 Internal Server Error</em> response. This was not your fault, but you can <a href="http://spamty.eu/contact-dev.php">contact us</a> so we have a look for a fix.</p>

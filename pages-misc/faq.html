<h2>How does authentication work?</h2>
<p>Simply send the username (<code>apiUser</code>) and your API key (<code>apiKey</code>) as HTTP POST parameters. You can <a href="{{site.url}}/apikeys/">get them here</a>.</p>

<h2>Can I use an API that is marked as "only internal use"?</h2>
<p>These APIs are really only for internal use. You cannot use them if you are not part of the Spamty team.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="https://spamty.eu/contact-dev.php">contact me</a> if you have any questions about the Spamty API.</p>

<h2>How does authentication work?</h2>
<p>Simply send the username (<code>apiUser</code>) and your API key (<code>apiKey</code>) as HTTP POST parameters. You can <a href="{{site.url}}/apikeys/">get them here</a>.</p>

<h2>Can I use an API that is marked as "only internal use"?</h2>
<p>These APIs are really only for internal use. You cannot use them if you are not part of the Spamty team.</p>

<h2>Is it possible to bypass CloudFlare for API requests?</h2>
<p>All requests to our API are routed through the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> system. This makes the API much more faster and protects our servers.<br>
It is possible to bypass CloudFlare if you use <i>api-raw.spamty.eu</i> as domain. But be careful we cannot guarantee that this domain will stay available forever. We may take it down without any announcement. Furthermore the response time is more than twice as long as it is with CloudFlare.</p>
